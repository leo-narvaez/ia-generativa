New Technology to Combat Climate Change

A team of scientists has unveiled a groundbreaking technology aimed at reducing carbon emissions. The new carbon capture system, developed by researchers in Europe, can capture up to 90% of CO2 emissions from industrial plants. Experts say this could be a game-changer in the fight against climate change, as industries are one of the biggest contributors to global warming. The technology is expected to be implemented in several countries by 2026, helping to meet global carbon reduction goals.
